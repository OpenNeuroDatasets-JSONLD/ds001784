FILE DESCRIPTIONS
-----------------

EEG data, **_task-afmsit_acq-concat_eeg.fif

The DBS-OFF and DBS-ON runs of the affective multisource interference task (afMSIT) for each participant were concatenated (OFF followed by ON). Concatenation was performed to ensure that all preprocessing steps were performed equally (within participants) to the DBS OFF and DBS ON data. This helps to mitigate the chance of artifactual differences between these two conditions of interest.

Projections data, **_task-afmsit_acq-concat_proj.fif

We removed eyeblinks and muscle artifacts with signal space projection (SSP). The SSP operators for each file are stored in the projection files and can be loaded with mne-python.

Metadata, **_task-afmsit_acq-concat_channels.tsv

The concatenated raw files are shared in the derivatives folder. In other words, no filtering has been applied to these data yet (filters were later applied prior to epoching, see code below). For transparency, we include metadata files indicating the channels we identified as "good" or "bad". Channels were deemed bad for reasons including (1) high impedence, (2) significant EMG artifact, and/or (3) signal loss.

NOTES
-----
Of the 14 participants, 6 were excluded from EEG analysis during preprocessing. Four participants were excluded because their EEG data were recorded without the use of a digitization system. Their data could thus not be accurately source localized. Two more participants were excluded from further EEG analysis due to substantial electromyographic artifact, which resulted in the rejection of the vast majority of trials following the quality assurance procedures described above. The EEG data of the remaining eight participants were analyzed.
