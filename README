Three anatomical fiducials were digitized for aligning the MEG with the MRI: the nasion
(lowest depression between the eyes) and the left and right ears (lowest depression
between the tragus and the helix, above the tragus). This procedure is illustrated here:

The following triggers are included in the trigger channels of the .fif files:

Channel            Event               Description
Trig1              Onset               Start of trial (onset of IAPS)
Trig2              Onset               Start of response window (onset of MSIT)
Trig1              Offset              Response time
Trig2              Offset              End of trial
